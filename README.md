# Space_Invaders

Our project is a single-player shooting game where the player uses the joystick to move the already shooting spaceship to eliminate waves of enemies coming towards the spaceship. The player will have 4 lives which will decrease whenever an enemy collides. There will also be a score counter which will be incremented whenever an enemy is eliminated. The game is implemented on a Basys 3 FPGA board using Verilog HDL.
